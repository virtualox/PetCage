# PetCage
**PetCage** is a World of Warcraft addon that automatically manages duplicate battle pets in your collection. When you acquire a new pet that is already present in your Pet Journal, PetCage will automatically place the duplicate in a cage for you. Additionally, if there are any existing duplicates of the pet that are still at level 1, PetCage will also cage those. Pets that are above level 1 will never be caged, ensuring your higher-level pets remain safe and available for battle.

PetCage is designed to simplify pet management, making it easier for players to maintain a streamlined and organized pet collection.
