**PetCage** is a World of Warcraft addon that automatically manages duplicate battle pets in your collection. When you acquire a new pet that is already present in your Pet Journal, **PetCage** will automatically place the duplicate in a cage for you. Additionally, if there are any existing duplicates of the pet that are still at level 1, **PetCage** will also cage those. Pets that are above level 1 will never be caged, ensuring your higher-level pets remain safe and available for battle.

**PetCage** is designed to simplify pet management, making it easier for players to maintain a streamlined and organized pet collection.

### Commands
The addon provides the following commands for additional control and customization:

- **`/petcage help`**: Displays a list of all available commands and their descriptions.
- **`/petcage toggle`**: Enables or disables the auto-caging functionality. When enabled, all duplicate pets acquired will be automatically caged. When disabled, this automatic behavior will stop.
- **`/petcage cage`**: Manually triggers the process to cage all duplicate pets that are not favorited and are at or below level 1.
